_Nothing yet._

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-13

The first tagged release since v0.1.0. It spans the performance +
real-physics work (ported 2026-06-11) and the documentation, landing-page,
defense-deck and overlay-fix follow-up (2026-06-12/13).

### Documentation, landing page & deck (2026-06-12/13)

- **Defense deck + design report brought up to v0.2.0** (were stuck at
  v0.1.0 / May content). `docs/slides.pdf` 24 → 29 pages,
  `docs/report.pdf` 18 → 22 pages. Added: a `--real-blocks` /
  `--collab` / `--experiment` feature section (slides) and matching
  `§5.5–5.8` implementation subsections (report); a derivation of the
  offset-tower topple criterion (`1.5d > r ⇒ d > 6.67 cm`, report
  `§4.6`); a physics-optimization slide/section replacing the now-false
  "no optimizable bottleneck" claim with the three-lever story
  (`step()` 11.9 → 0.30 ms, ≈40×). Refreshed every stale stat: 214 → 250
  tests, module table 6612 → 7730 lines, FPS table re-measured across
  all six modes, evolution table, limitations, `make`-based run/test
  commands, git commit. All feature facts source-verified.
- **GitHub Pages landing page** — "The physics got real — v0.2.0" section
  (offset-tower experiment figures, two-arm collab relay capture, the
  `--real-blocks` KINEMATIC-grasp story); stats pinned to repo ground
  truth (250 tests, 56.2 fps); absolute `og:image` / `twitter:image` for
  social crawlers; footer points at releases + changelog.
- `test_docs_site.py` — 10 parity tests pinning the landing page to the
  README badges and `demo_live.__version__` (no-newton CI subset).
- **Fixed a misleading `--experiment` CoM overlay**: `com_overlay()`
  compared the *all-layers* mean (excursion = offset) against the bottom
  block's support half-width, so across the whole 0/4/9 cm schedule it
  stayed green and **never flipped amber even as the tower toppled**. It
  now uses the CoM of the layers resting on the bottom block (top two, at
  1.5·offset) — flips amber at 9 cm exactly when XPBD topples it, matching
  the lecture's criterion. Two regression tests pin the 4 cm-stable /
  9 cm-amber bracket (suite 248 → 250); `experiment_topple.png` recaptured
  with the corrected amber overlay.

### Performance + real physics (2026-06-11 port)

The work that raised the demo's technical ceiling, ported from the
development working tree, plus a review pass (multi-agent, adversarially
verified) over the result.

#### Added

- **`--real-blocks` mode** — the colored blocks become genuine Newton
  rigid bodies that stack, topple and collide. Grasping is a KINEMATIC
  toggle (XPBD has no weld constraints): the held block's pose is
  prescribed from the gripper each frame, flipped back to DYNAMIC on
  release. Double-grab / release-without-grab / out-of-bounds-while-held
  are guarded. Default stays teleport (rehearsal-safe).
- **`--collab` mode** — two-arm collaborative tower build replaces
  Arm B's mindless workpiece shuttle whenever the stage is idle: Arm A
  fetches blocks to a handoff slot, Arm B stacks them into a tower,
  roles reverse for teardown, then it loops (`collab.py`). Yields
  instantly on any user activity.
- `World.recover_out_of_bounds()` — the main loop's stray-block
  auto-recovery extracted into a tested World method (held blocks are
  never snapped away mid-carry).
- **`--experiment` mode** — Arm B's offset-tower stability lecture
  (`experiment.py`): each round it stacks its three grey workpieces
  (two new parts, `slate` + `zinc`, join the workpiece inside its reach
  band) with a per-layer offset of 0 → 4 → 9 cm, and real XPBD dynamics
  delivers the verdict — with 10 cm-half-width cubes the top two layers'
  CoM sits 1.5 d off the bottom block, so theory says topple at
  d > 6.7 cm; the 4 cm round survives, the 9 cm round genuinely
  collapses. A live overlay draws the CoM plumb line against the
  support-base bracket (amber the moment the criterion flips), the
  bracketing physics is pinned by a real-solver regression test, and
  Arm A stays free for the audience throughout. Implies
  `--industrial --real-blocks`; mutually exclusive with `--collab`.
- `make real-blocks`, `make collab`, `make experiment`, `make test-ci`
  targets; `NEWTON=` variable to point at a non-sibling Newton clone.
- 24 new tests: real-blocks grasp/stacking/OOB guards (9), collab
  build order + teardown order + admire-hold + loop-back via stub
  executors (5), stability-experiment rounds/verdicts/CLI + the XPBD
  topple-threshold pin (9), CoM overlay render smoke (1).
  Suite: 214 → 238.

#### Changed

- **Physics step is ~39× cheaper in teleport mode** (11.9 ms → ~0.3 ms):
  solver iterations 20 → 2 (teleport) / 8 (real-blocks), substeps 4 → 2,
  `sim_dt` 1/240 → 1/120 (substeps × sim_dt must stay = 1/60), and a
  teleport-mode `collide()` skip that reuses a prebuilt empty contacts
  object — there are no real contacts to find in that mode. Uncapped
  headless throughput ~279 fps.
- `render.py` sketch primitives use precomputed jitter tables instead
  of constructing `random.Random(seed)` per line (profiler hotspot);
  the hand-drawn wobble is unchanged.
- Block spawn layout is now a single source of truth
  (`config.BLOCK_LAYOUT`) shared by `physics.World`, the keyword
  parser's drive targets and Claude's system prompt — the language side
  had drifted to positions the blocks no longer occupy.
- All Makefile launch/test targets inject the sibling Newton clone via
  `uv run --with "newton[sim] @ ../newton"`, so they work out of the
  box in this standalone repo (previously every target failed without a
  manually pre-installed Newton).

#### Fixed

- **F5 one-key rehearsal did nothing in live sessions** — the step
  engine was gated on `--scripted rehearsal`, so the on-stage warm-up
  key only showed a banner. It now drains the queue in any session.
- **F5 permanently disabled Claude** — the keyword-fallback swap was
  never undone; after a warm-up the actual show silently ran without
  Claude. The original CLI entry point is now restored by an explicit
  `rehearsal:end` step (with a "Claude re-enabled" status line).
- Interrupting the collaborative build mid-carry in teleport mode left
  the held block floating in mid-air (no gravity to settle it); it now
  drops to the ground at its current x.
- Status log backlog is capped (only the last 6 lines ever render;
  hours-long booth sessions no longer grow it unbounded).
- One-time diagnostic line when the window resolution forces the
  per-frame `smoothscale` path (~1–2 ms/frame), so a dropped-fps report
  on an odd projector resolution is explainable.
- `--collab` was silently inert under `--bench` (the Arm B idle gate
  also disabled it), making the collaborative build impossible to
  benchmark or capture headless. Collab now has its own gate: rehearsal
  scripts still own Arm B exclusively, but a plain `--bench` lets the
  relay run — it *is* the load worth measuring. Verified with two 90 s
  headless captures (teleport: 55.0 avg fps; real-blocks: 56.8).
- `make collab` launches the stage-safe teleport relay; the physically
  honest but scrappy `--collab --real-blocks` combination (blocks bounce
  on release and topple into the parked workpiece across cycles) moved
  to `make collab-real` and is documented as experimental.
- Stale claims corrected across README / CONTRIBUTING / CI comments /
  landing page: test counts, line counts, module table (`collab.py`,
  `config.py`, `sfx.py` were missing), install instructions that could
  not work as written, and the "1 m = 120 px" comment (it's 180).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-21

Initial public release. A 3-minute classroom demo of embodied AI on a
MacBook — no GPU, no cloud.

### Added

#### Phase A — Test safety net

- `tests/test_scripted_flows.py` — 5 end-to-end regression tests for the
  `--scripted catch/pick/stack/vla` flows that assert on the world
  terminal state (not just FPS) via a new `--state-dump` JSON option.
- `tests/test_tasks.py` — 16 unit tests for `TaskExecutor` program
  builders + the `_ease_min_jerk` curve.
- `tests/test_render_smoke.py` — 20 tests that smoke every public
  `draw_*` surface on both the industrial `scene/` package and the
  legacy classroom renderer.

#### Phase B — Refactor

- New `scene/` package (`arm.py`, `world.py`, `chrome.py`) replaces the
  single 1387-line `scene.py`. All three split modules stay under the
  800-line project-rule ceiling.
- New helper modules in `demo_live/`:
  - `bootstrap.py` — Warp kernel prewarm + Arm B construction.
  - `pipeline.py` — single source of truth for the VLA action → arm
    program mapping (`world_snapshot`, `build_plan_from`).
  - `scripted.py` — rehearsal script constants + Arm B idle cycle data.

#### Phase C — Robustness and expressiveness

- Amber banner + footer cheatsheet when a command returns
  `action="unknown"` (R.1, R.2 later make this fast-path responsive).
- Catcher commit-moment ring rendered the frame `committed_target`
  becomes non-None — audience can see the arm's decision instant.
- Voice transcription gets a per-recognizer `operation_timeout`
  (replacing the previous process-wide `socket.setdefaulttimeout` that
  could leak into other in-process socket users).
- Voice failure surfaces an amber banner explaining the timeout instead
  of silently leaving the input box empty.
- `BallCatcher._predict` warns once per pitch (not per frame) when the
  ballistic discriminant goes negative; `World.launch_ball` clamps
  z to `[0, 2]` and velocity magnitude to `MAX_BALL_SPEED = 20 m/s`.

#### Phase D — New features

- **VLA · PARSED side panel** showing `user`, `via`, `latency_ms`,
  `action`, `color`, `colors`, `target`, `reason` for the last command.
  Up to 7 fields visible on both render paths.
- **Four decorative gestures** wired through `pipeline.build_plan_from`:
  `wave`, `point` (left / right / audience), `bow`, `dance`. Available
  via typed text, voice, and the keyword fallback parser.
- **Slow-motion celebration** (1.5 s @ 0.33× dt) after a successful
  catch or after a multi-step program completes. Gated on
  `executor.busy == False` so in-flight waypoints stay visually
  coherent (see R.3 below).
- **`telemetry.py`** — per-event CSV logger writing `logs/demo-<ts>.csv`
  with mode switches, preflight dispatches, VLA calls (with latency +
  backend), voice transcripts, and catch attempts. Exit summary
  prints to stdout. Opt out with `--telemetry-off`.

#### Phase W — Construction refactor

- `bootstrap.make_arm_b(world, *, industrial, anchor_world_x)` — the
  four reset paths (init, R-key, rehearsal `reset:`, self-heal) now
  share one construction site for the secondary FK-only arm.

#### Phase X — Arm B idle loop

- Arm B perpetually cycles gestures whenever its executor is idle and
  no rehearsal is running. Configured via
  `scripted.ARM_B_IDLE_CYCLE` + `scripted.ARM_B_IDLE_PAUSE_S`. Disable
  with `--no-arm-b-idle`. Automatic in scripted / bench modes.

#### Phase Y — Workpiece shuttle

- New "workpiece" 5th block placed at `x=2.0` (inside Arm B's reachable
  zone). Arm B's idle cycle was upgraded from decorative gestures to
  ping-pong shuttling the workpiece between `x=1.5` and `x=2.5` — looks
  like real industrial pick-and-place.

#### Test growth

- Round T added `test_effects.py` (19) and `test_control.py` (13).
- Round U added `test_catcher.py` (18).
- Round V added `test_vla_subprocess.py` (17).
- Round X added `test_scripted_constants.py` (7).
- Final suite: **214 tests / 102 s wall clock / 100 % passing**.

### Changed

- **`scene.py` 1387 → 0 lines** by splitting into `scene/arm.py` (660),
  `scene/world.py` (228), `scene/chrome.py` (238) + the re-export
  `scene/__init__.py`.
- **`__main__.py` 1066 → 1139 lines** after consolidating helper
  extractions (the bootstrap / pipeline / scripted extractions removed
  ~95 lines but the C, D, R, S, T, X, Y features added new code; net
  cost roughly +75 lines for substantially more functionality).
- Industrial side-panel `AI · PARSED` block expanded from 5 rows × 24
  chars to 7 rows × 36 chars so the new `user` / `via` / `latency`
  fields fit alongside the existing parse output.
- Block out-of-bounds recovery threshold lifted from `|x| > 2.2` to
  `|x| > 3.0` to make room for Arm B's `x=2.5` shuttle endpoint.

### Fixed

#### CRITICAL

- **R.1** — `_fire_parse` preflight action whitelist had
  `{pick, place, stack, drive, home}` but the new gestures were never
  added. As a result `_keyword_fallback` would return `action="wave"`
  but preflight would coerce it back to `"unknown"`, so all four
  gestures had to wait 7–15 s for Claude before the arm moved.
- **R.2** — `_fire_parse` filtered `pre_colors` through `KNOWN_COLORS`
  unconditionally. For the `point` gesture, `colors` carries the
  direction (`left` / `right` / `audience`), not a colour — so every
  `point` command silently fell back to the `left` default.

#### HIGH

- **R.3** — Slow-motion was triggered unconditionally on the catch /
  done falling edge, but `TaskExecutor.update` time-tracks via
  `time.perf_counter()` (not `dt`), so in-flight pick / stack segments
  would visually desynchronize when the catch slow-mo halved `dt`.
  Gated slow-mo on `executor.busy == False`.
- **R.4** — Pressing `2 Enter` twice quickly created two `parse_thread`
  daemon threads writing to the same `parse_result` dict. The older
  worker could clobber the newer one's result. Added a generation
  counter so stale workers drop their results on completion.
- **R.5** — `test_scripted_catch` asserted `catch_count >= 1` over an
  8 s window — flaky if XPBD jitter tightened catch tolerance.
  Split into two tests (auto-launcher fired, ≥ 50 % caught) over
  12 s.

#### MEDIUM / LOW

- **R.6** — `voice.transcribe` replaced `socket.setdefaulttimeout` with
  `recognizer.operation_timeout` so the timeout no longer leaks into
  other in-process socket users.
- **R.7** — Rehearsal `arm_b:` branch now calls
  `pipeline.build_plan_from` instead of duplicating dispatch logic.
  Arm B automatically picks up new actions (gestures + drive).
- **R.8** — `telemetry._sanitize` prefixes cells starting with
  `= + - @ \t` with a single quote so Excel does not evaluate them
  as formulas when opening the debrief CSV.
- **R.9** — Added `tests/test_pipeline.py` with 20 tests covering every
  action branch — would have caught R.1 immediately.
- **R.10** — `telemetry.TelemetryLogger` type annotations changed from
  `TextIOBase | None` / `csv.writer | None` to `IO[str] | None` /
  `Any` (the originals lied about the runtime types).
- **Y.1** — `TaskExecutor._ensure_reachable` early-exits for
  fixed-base arms (Arm B). The previous unconditional `make_drive`
  call would mutate `world.drive_to` and yank Arm A's mobile base
  whenever Arm B picked a block.

#### Polish

- **S.1** — Removed dead `_request_exit` / `_finish` stubs.
- **S.2** — Replaced `O(n²)` `world.blocks.index(block)` with
  `enumerate` in the out-of-bounds recovery loop.
- **S.3** — `launch_ball` clamps velocity magnitude to 20 m/s.
- **S.4** — Telemetry now logs the preflight dispatch, not just
  Claude's eventual response. The CSV now explains "arm moved at
  T+1 ms while Claude returned at T+9.4 s".
